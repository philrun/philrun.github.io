##Amazon responded tonight

For reference, see [my earlier blog post about Amazon Customer Services]({% post_url 2014-08-01-Amazon-Customer-Services %})

I'll post the relevant bits...a GBP10 "goodwill gesture" is, quite frankly, an insult for the accusations and time I've spent on this issue this evening

Amazon - the ball is in your court, please feel free to contact me again.

##Amazon response (extract)

After reviewing our previous correspondence with you, please accept my apologies for any misunderstanding caused. 

This situation was the result of a technical error, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused. 

As we understand the system should have recorded the details correctly(like Recipient Name) before passing on the same to carrier for delivery of a package.This is the first complaint we have received so far with regard to Collect Plus package deliveries with the missing information. 

I would surely check with the Internal team to see how this situation could have happened and really thank you for bringing this to our attention. 

I understand the inconvenience this situation has caused and on this occasion, I would like to give you a GBP 10.00 promotional gift certificate as a goodwill gesture, for use towards your next Amazon.co.uk order.
