## I did it

I got out, and had a little run...

Sadly not as fast and far as I wanted to go...but I covered 5k before deciding I should call it a day and have a walk back.

I've always had the mantra that if it didn't feel good, then stop...cos it'll only cause something like an injury or hurt etc.

But...it was a start
