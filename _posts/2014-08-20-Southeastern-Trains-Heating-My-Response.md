##Still hot

For the last two days I've been on trains with heating on at 0740 in the morning. Granted, it has got cooler outside, but nowhere near needing heating on the train for those appropriately dressed for outside temperatures.

I also got myself a point and click thermometer to measure temperatures, to verify temperatures in the carriage, as well as the temperature coming from the heaters.

I'll keep this short, and post what I wrote to Southeastern tonight.

When they respond, I'll update this further

##My response to Southeastern

Hi,

Following up on your response dated 7th August (Ref: 809273), I would like to make the following points:

- Your quoting of HSE recommendations refers to outdated recommendations: [http://www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/faq.htm ]( http://www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/faq.htm) 
- Average London temperatures for July/Aug range from 13C to 23C which fall well within your interpretation of old guidelines - [http://www.holiday-weather.com/london/averages/ ](http://www.holiday-weather.com/london/averages/) 
- On class 376 trains, the heating exhaust is just above the legs of someone seated.  This morning I measured ambient train temp at 21C, but the heating blowing out 31C - [https://vine.co/v/M333D05DaMF](https://vine.co/v/M333D05DaMF) 
- The World Health Organisation recommended temps for someone 'appropriately dressed' is 18C - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12606943 ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12606943)  - and from the same BBC article, anything above 21C has some discomfort. Sitting next to a heater at 30C could fall into the 'risk of stroke and heart attack' category

With this in mind, as well as your environmental commitments ([http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/about-us/sustainability/environment/](http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/about-us/sustainability/environment/)) could you please consider lowering the set point of your heating on the train to 18C for the sake of the health of your passengers, as well as the planet?

As with previous correspondence, unless explicitly stated in your response, I will share this with on my blog - this message to you will be at [www.philrogers.me/0820a](http://www.philrogers.me/0820a) shortly.

I also invite you to read [www.philrogers.me/0817a](http://www.philrogers.me/0817a)  which has been read by over 100 people so far, a few of which have engaged with me via twitter.

Regards,

Phil
