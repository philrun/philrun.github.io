## I'll be quick

This will be one of my shorter blog posts on Southeastern, I've just about had enough of the lies that they put out in the interests of being transparent, and have sat on this one for a few days

So...here goes

## Sent to Southeastern, 30th September 2014

Hi, 

Re previous correspondence reference: 337563 / 836957 

With resepect, your Passenger Charter does state I can ask for this information. 

If you scroll to the section after 'Answering your enquiries' it states the following: 

"Keeping you updated on our customer service performance 

In addition to the four-weekly updates on train service performance we'll keep you informed of other aspects of our service from time to time, including: 

queuing times at ticket offices; 

our response times to the letters and web email forms you write; 

our performance in answering your telephone calls to our enquiry service; 

and feedback from the latest National Passenger Survey. 

If you do not have access to the Internet at home, you may be able to use facilities at your local public library, or you can request the information by contacting our Customer Services." 

Hence my request to Customer Services for this information - more specifically the second point in that list 

Or are you saying that your Passenger Charter contains yet another failed promise to your customers? As with previous correspondence, please explicitly state in the body of your response if you do not wish me to share your reply on my blog. 

Regards, 

Phil

## Received from Southeastern, 15th October 2014


Dear Mr Rogers
 
Thank you for your web form dated 30 September 2014.
 
In answer to your previous query: our Key Performance Indicator with regard to response times for correspondence received, states that all queries must receive a reply within 10 working days of receipt by us. This figure stands at 100% for 2014.
 
Thanks once again for contacting us; if there's anything else you'd like me to investigate then please don't hesitate to ask and I'll do my level best to help.
 
Yours sincerely

##100% performance? Really?

Let's do some quick maths:

This year I have sent 10 customer service questions via their web form to Southeastern

This year I have received 7 'Please Wait' responses from Southeastern.

For me: 30% of customer services received proper, non-automatically generated, responses within 10 days.

Let's extrapolate this:

For Southeastern to claim 100%, they need at least 99.5% (to round up to 100%)

This means that 0.51% need to have not been answered within 10 days.

If they only chose to not answer my 7 questions within 10 days, then that means at least 1365 other questions were answered within 10 working days.

(7/0.0051)

Now, call me a cynic, but I find this highly unlikely

##But wait, yes, look at the response again

Their Customer Relations Officer stated:

"our Key Performance Indicator with regard to response times for correspondence received, states that all queries must receive a reply within 10 working days of receipt by us. This figure stands at 100% for 2014."

What? a computer AUTOMATICALLY sending a please wait counts as a reply?

Surely not.

How is this possible?

Well, a weak Transport Minister, and Government letting Southeastern continually get away with treating their commuters in the way they do, and renewing their contracts allows for this.

##Southeastern - your turn

Please feel free to provide rebuttal to my statement above.

Commuters - have you sent Southeastern a message and got the same automated response that I received, within 2014? If so, then let me know, and we can do the maths to show that Southeastern are, [yet again](http://www.philrogers.me/1028a), lying to their customers.

And, Southeastern, if you can provide accurate, audited, stats to prove my claims to the contrary, I'm happy to publish a full apology.

Again, your turn.
