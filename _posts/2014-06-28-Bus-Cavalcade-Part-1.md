##Bus Cavalcade - The Year Of The Bus

On Sunday 22nd June 2014, Regent Street had one of its many Sunday road closures - to allow shoppers to have a traffic free day, whilst also providing some sort of entertainment and interesting events.

For this Sunday, apart from 48 buses (and some supporting vehicles), Regent Street was traffic free!  Despite having to get a bus replacement service to Slade Green as some work was being done on Dartford Station (they tore down the old temporary station), I went into London.

Here's the first set of photos that I took - from buses 1 to 20.

Part 2 is now here: [buses 21 to 35]({% post_url 2014-06-28-Bus-Cavalcade-Part-2 %})

With the final set here: [buses 36 to 48]({% post_url 2014-06-29-Bus-Cavalcade-Part-3 %})

I'll post the rest in the coming week - so check back for more!

Remember - Dartford Bus station is having an open day on [Sunday 7th September](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/our-events#on-this-page-3), I'll hopefully see some of you there!

I've taken the descriptions of each bus from the TfL leaflet that was handed out at the event - which gives you some background into what the bus is, and a little bit of history.

I've put the odd comment in amongst all the photos too...

##Bus 1 - Horse bus
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14469059256" title="DSC09428.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14469059256_bda396c324.jpg" width="426" height="500" alt="DSC09428.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14492162405" title="DSC09424.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14492162405_a37037bb19.jpg" width="309" height="500" alt="DSC09424.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1829-1914: </b>
<i>At one time 4,000 horse-drawn buses were in London. The last ran in 1914, with the horses being required for WWI.</i>

There wasn't a horse with this one though... 

##Bus 2 - Leyland X2 Motor Bus

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14492166895" title="DSC09429.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2935/14492166895_7ddd4e0cc6_z.jpg" width="640" height="521" alt="DSC09429.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1908-c1914: </b>
<i>The X-Type, the first London bus designed especially for use in the Capital, employed the latest technology. Just sixty were built.</i>

Having had buses around all of my life, it's weird to think that until the early 1900s, they were pulled by horses!


##Bus 3 - AEC B-type (B2737)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14305532630" title="DSC09439.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14305532630_ddd273b9b7_z.jpg" width="429" height="640" alt="DSC09439.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1914-1922: </b>
<i>London's first successful mass-produced motorbus. In 1914, many were used for the war effort and transported troops to the Front Line.</i>


##Bus 4 - AEC K-type (K424)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14305574098" title="DSC09443.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3903/14305574098_76032ccc31_z.jpg" width="345" height="640" alt="DSC09443.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1920-1932: </b>
<i>Successor to the B-type, the K-type had a more powerful engine. The K-type established the layout of a modern bus.</i>

The back of this bus reminded me of the styling used on the New Bus for London


##Bus 5 - AEC S-type (S433)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14490902264" title="DSC09452.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3892/14490902264_f91b2cb461_z.jpg" width="640" height="538" alt="DSC09452.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1922-1932: </b>
<i>Further development of the K-type produced the updated S-type. Weighing 8.5 tons' it raised the seating capacity to 54 passengers.</i>


##Some Bus infiltrators!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14491022852" title="DSC09464.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3920/14491022852_cc9b9b5ff7_z.jpg" width="640" height="555" alt="DSC09464.jpg"></a>

These two don't seem to be described in the TfL documentation, I guess they crept in, or have been delayed on Regent Street for nearly a century


##Bus 6 - Leyland LB5 (Chocolate Express)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14548152403" title="DSC09478.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3922/14548152403_ca5a0a2625_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC09478.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1924-1934: </b>
<i>Lovingly restored by Mike Sutcliffe after being found derelict at a farm in 1984, this was one of the pre-1934 London independents.</i>

It's at this point on my walk down the street that I started taking photos of the insignias at the front of some of the buses

##Bus 7 - AEC NS-type (NS1995)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14524640751" title="DSC09491.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/14524640751_275b23e205_z.jpg" width="640" height="632" alt="DSC09491.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1926-1937: </b>
<i>NS-type broke new ground, with a lower platform height. Initially built with an open top, it was modified to have a covered top.</i>


##Bus 8 - AEC Renown (LT165)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14504927126" title="DSC09497.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3893/14504927126_f1075d3013_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC09497.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1930-1949: </b>
<i>With more passengers, buses needed to be longer. London Transport (LT-types) were among the first to be converted to diesel engines.</i>


##Bus 9 - AEC Renown (LT1076)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14341599437" title="DSC09507.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3877/14341599437_179cf71ecb_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="DSC09507.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1931-1950: </b>
<i>Single deck buses were required for quieter routes, or those with low bridges. A longer AEC Renown 3-axle chassis was used.</i>

It got really difficult to take photos with just the bus, and as few people as possible - without waiting for absolutely ages...so yeah, there were people on Regent Street - look at them! So many of them!

##Bus 10 - Leyland Cub (C4)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14528037185" title="DSC09509.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14528037185_67aa59a23d_z.jpg" width="606" height="640" alt="DSC09509.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1935-1953: </b>
<i>One of 76 Leyland Cubs bought by LT. Removed from service in 1953 and initially used on fruit picking farms for staff transport.</i>


##Bus 11 - Tree lopper (formerly STL1470)

<b>In service 1936-1953: </b>
<i>The ST family was produced with a variety of body styles, eventually gaining a modern fully enclosed cab and a full-length upper deck.</i>

A bus made for cutting trees - these days I'm sure buses just drive fast at them in the hope the branches fall off (of course they don't)

##Bus 12 - AEC STL-type (STL2377)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125707117@N03/14527040522" title="DSC09535.jpg by Phil Rogers, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/14527040522_4f5c5a2d15_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC09535.jpg"></a>

<b>In service 1938-1954: </b>
<i>Delivered to Grays Garage in 1938 for Green Line duties and commandeered in 1939 for use as ambulances in WWII.</i>

This bus would've served the area where I grew up - way way before I was born, cos I'm not that old!

<b>In service 1948-1962: </b>
