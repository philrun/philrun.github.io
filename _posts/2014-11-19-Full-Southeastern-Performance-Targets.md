##Southeastern PPM

I haven't got time to write a full analysis of this as planned, so here's the PPM targets for Southeastern's new franchise, as well as exportable CSV.

Targets, as with the Dartford lines, are below previous performance...feel free to distribute this data as you see fit!

Past 6 months:

Next 6 months:

And in perspective, the same 6 months last year:
