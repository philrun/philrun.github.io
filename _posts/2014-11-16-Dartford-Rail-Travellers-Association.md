##Welcome to: Dartford Rail Travellers Association (DRTA)

I've been engaging in conversation with David Statham and his team at Southeastern since meeting him on the BBC Radio Kent show that I joined in October, and one question I wanted to put to him on air was if he'd entertain the possibility of coming to speak to Dartford commuters.

This question came up in a recent exchange whilst talking about the PPM figures, and there was a suggestion that if there was a Dartford commuter group, then that's when Southeastern would typically join.

So...I decided it's time for us to have a group, in a similar vein to the Sevenoaks Rail Travellers Association, who do a great job communicating news important to that area and calling Southeastern to account.

##Not just me...

I didn't want the group to be just me running it.  It didn't feel right to have sole control over a group that I hope would be an important place for commuters, plus I couldn't do this alone, with the elections coming up in under 6 months!

I sent a message to Mike Pellatt, who is as vocal as me on Twitter about the shortcomings of Southeastern - it turns out he already registered a domain for such a group and he was interested in forming a group.

So the next day, after a couple of beers, DRTA was born

##What the group is for

A voice for Dartford commuters. That's all of us in the Borough of Dartford for the seven stations that we have: Dartford, Greenhithe, Stone Crossing, Swanscombe, Longfield, Farningham Rd, Ebbsfleet

It is a community group, and all opinions are welcome, as well as all political views - this group is not aligned to, or the voice of, any political party.  Disclaimer: I'm involved with the local Labour Party, this group is not affiliated with them, though I'm likely to all out the current Govt who handed over the keys to 4 more years to Govia, rather than calling them to account and setting them good targets. 

Anyway, with two of us leading the group, that will ensure a good degree of balance.

And it's for you. Rail users, whether it's for the daily commute, or for occasional travel.

##Fancy a drink?

I do!

And our first meeting of the group will be on Wednesday 26th November in The Forresters pub on Great Queen Street - it's a short walk from the station, Mike knows the staff there, and we'll have a little area to use.  As well as drink (though you'll have to pay for that!)

The first meeting will be informal, as I hope future ones will be, and give us a chance to chat over a drink or two about what issues we have on the railway, and help shape the direction of the group
