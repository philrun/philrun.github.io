##So I'm running London this year

Oh yes.

I am.

Those who know me would be like: woah, really? why?

I declared that my 20th in San Antonio in December would be last - running with a good friend who did her 100th there.

Little did I know, or remember, that I did the same thing that I do every year (unless for some reason I miss the deadline) and registered for the London Marathon ballot.

Cos I won't get in, but it's worth a go.

I did in 2009, that was lucky, but again? of course not. But it's something I should try at...right?

##October came...

Those that I follow on Twitter and Facebook were talking about the Virgin London Marathon ballot...they received those sad magazines, that said they hadn't got in.

I expected that on my doormat that evening.

Nothing.

But...being the busy monkey I am, I didn't think any more about it...until the next evening when I saw tweets about receiving the PDF version.

Oh! the PDF version, yeah, I must've selected that, the magazine usually goes in the bin after a cursory glance.

Nearing my station on the train, I checked my spam folders, all my folders, the gmail app vs the google inbox app. Nothing.

Oh.

Oh.

OH.

##Got home

A "You're In" magazine.

Woah.

There is no way I could possibly back out of this one...can I?

It's a prized place. IN THE BALLOT!!!

Fine...there's my incentive to train properly for San Antonio (#20) then.

##Training for San Antonio?

LOL.

Yeah right. I did 4 miles of training before (and the 2 miles to run to the start)

But I did it.

The least training for any marathon I've done - Honolulu the year before was close, which I'll blog, at some point, soon.

##So this blog...

I'm going to use it to record my training.

And also look at how that's reflected in my health... through a variety of internet connect devices. But I'm going to leave that for another blog post, as I just want to get the site up this evening

##Why the rush?

After a few train related events today, and doing a 'google check' on a few key words, I realised that this site was bubbling in the top 10 for some keywords.

Top 10?

Yeah, cos I built a bunch of SEO stuff into each of my sites, so it did it, with no publicity.

And then I got an email about train related stuff to this domain.

So I'm putting it live, and you can watch it evolve

##The important bit: Charity

As with 2009 when I got a ballot place, I'm going to run for charity this year. More notably: two charities.

Again, I want to write about this in a bit more detail later...but they are (and I'm going to steal this from what I wrote on my Virgin Money Giving page):

<b>Stroke Association</b> - both my parents have had strokes over the last decade, and the Stroke Association do a lot of good work to support those affected, as well as making awareness of what to do for those experiencing a stroke

<b>Special Effect</b> - this charity does a lot to help those with disabilities be able to play video games, through a variety of customised technologies suitable for the individual needing help.

##Want to donate?

Go on, you know you do.

And all your money (apart from the tiny amount Virgin Money take to process the donation) will go to the charites in a 50:50 split.

All of it.

It's my ballot place, neither charity have paid for me to run this marathon.

I'll pay for it, with training, better quality blood, a lot of sweat, maybe some tears at the end.

So dig deep, and spare whatever you can.

Then sit back and watch as I ramp up my training over the coming weeks and months

##...and then?

I'll write more soon. 

I have a couple of training runs to add to the site, and comments around them...only 8 miles since the first post, but getting faster each run.

So, stay tuned!

But not tonight - I've written so much in the last fortnight on my various sites that I'm involved with...run out of words...
