##Hi, my name's Phil...

...and welcome to my little place on the big internet.

I've lived in Dartford for the last 12 years, and by day work for a games console manufacturer, specialising in all things network...well my team do, I just look after them!

I'll write a proper 'About me' eventually, just not today, if that's good with you?

###What's this all about then?

Indeed, and that's a very good question!

I've used the internet in some shape or form to get my views out there whether it's:

* having a rant about something
* talking about some cool new piece of technology I've encountered
* talking about a cool piece of technology that is broken
* the trains being late
* the bins not being collected
* other local issues that annoy or frustrate me
* music
* the weather
* the price of cheese (I don't actually follow the price of cheese)

More recently I've taken to Twitter, which is an art-form in itself - getting a thought, or an idea, out in 140 characters (or much less when you have other tweeters in that message).

I had a Wordpress account ages ago, that wasn't that well used, I think due to me wanting to do more custom stuff (see below!), so this site will serve as a place for me to talk about stuff, in more detail than Twitter lets me.

I guess, in essence, this site is for you to get to know me, for those of you crazy enough to want to.

###Always evolving...

I could've put in a 1990s style 'Under Construction' bit here, but I won't (hmm maybe later I will) - however this site is still in a development state, I'll tweak it bits over the coming weeks and months, sometimes it'll go down...however there'll always be at least one sync, somewhere, cos I'm paranoid like that.

If you see something broken, or have some ideas then feel free to contact me about it - most posts will have a comments field on, and I'm contactable by a number of electronic means:

###Contact me

###The technology running this site

Cos it'd be remiss of me to not talk about it, and also why I've not followed the Wordpress route.

Well...I wanted something that I had a bit more control over, could do clever stuff with (if I had the time, inclination, ideas, and skill*) at some point in the future.

Github Pages as recommended by one of the guys at work seemed to fit what I wanted, so after a weekend's tweaking, I've managed to get this up - a site that's mine, that I can take wherever I want to, whenever I want to

Plus tags mean that you can look at specific areas of my mind, without reading everything (cos, hey, listening to my train/bin moans gets boring after a while, doesn't it?)

###My thoughts, My disclaimer

Obviously, I need to point out that what I post on this site are my own thoughts, and do not reflect the thoughts of my employer, or any other affiliations I may have - unless otherwise stated.

But you're all clever people, and have figured that one out already, just needed to be said.
