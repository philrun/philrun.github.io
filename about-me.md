##Hello! I'm Phil -  I live in Dartford, and work in Central London.

I've been keeping this blog since early 2014, starting with a write-up of the troubles I had with Recycling collections in the Newtown ward of Dartford, and the subsequent actions that I took, to work with Dartford Borough Council to get this resolved, as well as putting forward my views for what could, and should be done.

I've also written a few other things here and there, and been instrumental in getting some other problems fixed in the area that I live.

##Southeastern and Dartford

Regular readers of my blog will know of the ongoing issues that I, as well as the majority of commuters, face weekly on Southeastern.  A lot of my posts are about this, so if you're not a commuter, I apologise, if you are a commuter, then I guess you understand my commuting frustrations.

As a result of my commentary about Southeastern I was put forward to spend an hour with BBC Radio Kent, the new Southeastern MD, and other rail users - which spawned email conversations with the MD after, and the formation of Dartford Rail Travellers Association with a fellow local commuter - covering the seven stations in the Borough of Dartford

##Elections - May 7th 2015

I am the Prospective Candidate for the Local Elections in Newtown, Dartford for May 2015 - part of the team with Cllr Dave Baker, and other prospective candidate, Dali Rai.

If you're in the Newtown area, and have issues to raise, then contact details are <a href="about.html">here</a>. Twitter is best for an immediate response.

I'll be out and about over the coming weeks to listen to your feedback on the local area, and with your support, be able to act on it in an official capacity later in May.
